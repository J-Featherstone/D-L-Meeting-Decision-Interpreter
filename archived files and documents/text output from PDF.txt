Notice of Decision
Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended)
Dear Sir/Madam
APPLICATION: 3/21/2302/HH
PROPOSAL: Retention of raised concrete hardstanding to provide 1 car parking space
AT: 304A Ware Road Hertford Hertfordshire SG13 7ER
FOR: Mr And Mrs L And S Peffers
Further to my earlier consultation regarding this proposal, I write to inform you that this
matter was considered by the Council on the 4th February 2022 and it was decided to
Refuse Planning Permission subject to the following:
 1. The existing development has resulted in a raised platform being created that
provides unrestricted views into the rear gardens and ground floor fenestration of the
adjoining neighbouring properties at close proximity resulting in a detrimental level of
overlooking to these properties and a significant loss of privacy. As such the proposal
fails to comply with Policy DES4 of the East Herts District Plan 2018.


Informatives:
 1. East  Herts  Council  has  considered  the  applicant's  proposal  in  a  positive  and
proactive manner and whether the planning objections to this proposal could be satisfactorily
resolved  within  the  statutory  period  for  determining  the  application.   However,  for  the
reasons set out in this decision notice, the proposal is not considered to accord with the
Development Plan.
This Decision Relates to Plan Numbers:
20026-S002-1st  (Floor/Elevation - Existing)
20026-P002-A  (Proposed Plans, Elevations and Location)
